Hey there,

Over the past few years, **CodePath** has been bringing technology courses from Silicon Valley to campuses worldwide. We’re also proud of the fact that no individual has ever paid for a CodePath course. We believe the best education in the world should be *freely accessible* and we’ve been fortunate to work with great companies like **Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Box, and others** to help make this vision a reality.

The classes empower you to build **iOS apps**, provide hands-on practice focused on developing **defensive applications**, and many more technological advances (*read some of our accomplishments* [here](https://blog.codepath.com/2016/06/14/an-experiment-across-17-universities-shows-the-secret-to-diversifying-the-tech-industry/)) . Our courses are also endorsed by top tech companies including **Facebook, Airbnb, and other top Silicon Valley companies.**

The program has two goals:

1.	See if talented engineers and individuals are *distributed* across a variety of **socio-economic, ethnic, and gender backgrounds**; and
2.	Provide a **bridge** between traditional CS and industry programming standards that will directly lead to **job opportunities**.

We are excited to continue building and scaling **Codepath University** both locally and internationally. Over the next couple years, you’ll see many more courses added for students across areas like **Android, Web Security, and React.** We will work to *bridge the gap* not just between industry and universities but also across the socio-economic boundaries.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon,
