Hi **Kevin**,

We noticed that you have not filled out the [group survey](https://) yet.

As part of our educational model, above mentioned survey is needed to match you to a 3-person group. Kindly complete the group survey as soon as possible so we can assign you to a group and move forward with the course. Failure to do so will result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://).

Expecting compliance from you soon.

All the best,

**Patricia Chu**

CodePath, Course Coordinator
